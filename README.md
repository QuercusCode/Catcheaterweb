## Overview

Catcheater is a biotech startup developing an autonomous genetic circuit that eliminates "cheater" cells in E. coli fermentation. By coupling protein production to cell survival, we enable antibiotic-free, stable, and high-yield biomanufacturing.

This repository contains the source code for the Catcheater landing page and customer portal.
